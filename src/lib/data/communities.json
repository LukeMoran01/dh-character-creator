Traditionally, members of a highborne community possess incredible material wealth [1].

Highborne place great value on titles and possessions, and there is little social mobility within their ranks [1]. Members of a highborne community often control the political and economic status of the areas in which they live due to their ability to influence people and the economy with their substantial wealth [1]. The health and safety of the less affluent people who live in these locations often hinges on the ability of this highborne ruling class to prioritize the well-being of their subjects over profit [1].",

Other seaborne live on the water in small boats or large ships, with the idea of “home” comprising a ship and its crew, rather than any one landmass [5]. No matter their exact location, seaborne communities are closely tied to the ocean tides and the creatures who inhabit them [5]. Seaborne learn to fish at a young age, and train from birth to hold their breath and swim in even the most tumultuous waters [5]. Individuals from these groups are highly sought after for their sailing skills, and many become captains of vessels, whether within their own community, working for another, or even at the helm of a powerful naval operation [5].",
